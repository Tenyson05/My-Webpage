	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>HI! I'm Tenyson. My real name is Rojah Lewis. My first name is a variant of the word Roja which means red in Spanish. I have no idea why my parents chose to use a variant of the word Roja as my name but it some how matches my personality quite A bit.<br />
		The reason why I say so is because I have major anger management issue which I had difficult controlling up until 10th grade where I started to learn how to control it. I found various ways to use my anger as a source of motivation to never give up.<br />
		Despite having anger issues I am not a mean person I am quite loving and caring. Currently at the time of writing this I am 19 years old attending the University of Technology located in Jamaica where I am studying computer science. In the future I would like to become a Game programmer and would like to work for a company like Activision, Blizzard or EA.<br />
		You are probably wondering how I have the name Tenyson. Well Tenyson was the name of my first personal account on PSN. I wanted to use the name Tennyson as in Ben Tennyson from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_10"target="_blank">Ben 10</a> but it was taken so I decided to use Tenyon05. I choose to add 05 to it because of having 2 "n" it had 1. So I decided to use 05 instead of 10(Tenyson05 >> Tenyson10).<br />
		From there on I used Tenyson on all platforms I played on. I am often refer to as Teny since people I have meant in the gaming world always shorten Tenyson to Teny lol. I sometimes call my self Tenybot because at one point in my life of playing COD I got to a point where I had an insane accuracy locking on to target or whether they were moving or standing still. Sadly now due to university life I haven't been able to play much so I am not sure if I still have the ability to do so.<br />

	<p>I first got into gaming when I was 4 years old according to my father. He said that the first game I ever played using a Keyboard and Mouse was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_to_Castle_Wolfenstein"target="_blank">Return to Castle Wolfenstein</a> which is a first person
		shooter. According to my dad I didn't understand the keyboard much but slowly picked up on how the mouse worked after showing me over a million times lol. He said from there on forward I would play every day after school then I eventually started playing other games on pc such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)"target="_blank">Quake</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty"target="_blank">COD</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto"target="_blank">Grand Thedt Auto</a>, etc. He said I seem to have had a preference for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter"target="_blank">FPS</a> and until this day that is true, I still have a love for FPS. The think I love about fps the most is the fast pace adrenaline rush you get especially form games like COD and Quake.
		In 2007 I moved away fully from pc when It got broken and we couldn't afford another one since game graphics were getting more intense and pc parts were getting expensive. So instead I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)"target="_blank">PS1</a> and then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2"target="_blank">PS2</a> which I enjoyed but was missing my keyboard and mouse, the controller compared to the KM+B was really slowed. I later got a ps3 and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360"target="_blank">Xbox 360</a> then a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4"target="_blank">PS4</a>. In 2014 I was able to go back to the pc world with a 500 dollar built pc which I was super happy for. being able to use keyboard and mouse again. Enjoying that fast pace action with over 60 fps and a FOV slider was the best feeling I could ever have lol. I am still currently on pc and I don't plan on going back to console even though I will occasionally play on it.
		I started watching Anime 1 year prior to me starting to play games I have no information on which Anime I first watched but I do remember watching dragon ball z and staying up late at night in 2003 to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto"target="_blank">Naruto</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon_Network"target="_blank">Cartoon Network</a> and years later use to stay up even later to watch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_(anime)"target="_blank">Bleach</a> on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_Swim"target="_blank">Adult Swim</a>. Good ole Cartoon Network days HA!.<br /> 
		<br /> As for technology I started developing a love for technology in high school when I started to understand how they work. In grade 12 when I started to attend Belair high School That is where my love for Technology and Programming grew. I remember writing my first program using one of my teacher's program as a guide, even though correcting the errors was pain because I wasn't well knowledgeable on that area I got a really good feeling after spending more hours trying to correct the errors than actually writing the code. Clicking on that debug option and saw everything ran perfectly fine. Oh my gosh, I felt like a real programmer. I felt extreme happiness.

	<h4> My thoughts about stuff</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Game Dev Teams: </li>
			<p>	Lately it seems as if developers don't really care too much about a game's story mode or multiplayer. Dev teams just isn't putting enough effort or time into the making of proper game story. It's all about making a game every year with good graphics to catch everyone's attention and then making a mad ass trailer to make the game look good. But when that game is release. It's a a totally different story. Poor story mode which is like 5 hours long, bad ports with horrible frame per second drop/lag and a ton of glitches *cough cough* you know your self companies. I think that dev teams really need to look into
				actually making a game good and enjoyable instead of making the game poorly and releasing it because they know that the consumers will still buy it. Shout out to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD_Projekt"target="_blank">Projekt CD Red</a> for not following other companies and actually making <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_(video_game)"target="_blank">The Witcher</a> enjoyable, fun and not following the new trend of making horrible games because you know we would just buy it either way.
